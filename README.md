# I2C
Inter Integrated Circuit
It is a bus interface connection protocol incorporated into devices for serial communication.
It uses only 2 bi-directional open-drain lines for data communication called SDA and SCL. Both these lines are pulled high.
  Serial Data (SDA) – Transfer of data takes place through this pin.
  Serial Clock (SCL) – It carries the clock signal.

I2C operates in 2 modes –
  Master mode
  Slave mode
